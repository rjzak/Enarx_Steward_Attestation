\begin{frame}{What is Enarx?}

Enarx:
\begin{itemize}
\item runs WebAssembly (WASI) applications in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
\begin{itemize}
\item AMD SEV-SNP, Intel SGX/EDMM
\item Others can be supported!
\end{itemize}
\item is written in Rust
\item began as a project at Red Hat, was later a project of Profian, which came from Red Hat
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Workflow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Before running a job, Enarx caches the vendor's CRL, and for AMD, caches the CPU's public key (manual process)
    \item The Keep (what Enarx calls an initialized TEE) is created
    \item An Attestation Report is requested from the CPU
    \item A CSR is created, with the attestation report as an extension
    \item The CSR is sent to Steward for validation
    \item If valid, Steward responds with a proper X509 Certificate
    \item The Wasm file is loaded into memory and execution begins
    \item Enarx transparently wraps any network traffic with the Cert and internal private key to create TLS traffic
    \item Second parties can use the Steward-provided certificate to ensure attestation
\end{enumerate}
